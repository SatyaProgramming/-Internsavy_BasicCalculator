# Basic Calculator

This is a simple calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application is built using Java and Swing.

## Getting Started

To run the calculator application, you need to have Java installed on your machine. If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/.

Once you have Java installed, follow these steps to run the application:

1. Download the BasicCalculator.java file from this repository.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the BasicCalculator.java file.
3. Compile the Java source code by running the following command:

#
Sure, here's the code that you can copy and paste into your README.md file:

Copy code
# Basic Calculator

4. Run the application by running the following command:

#java BasicCalculator

The calculator application should open in a new window.

## How to Use

The calculator interface consists of a display area at the top and a keypad below it. To perform an operation, click on the appropriate button on the keypad. The numbers and operations will appear in the display area.

To clear the display, click on the "C" button.

To calculate the result of the expression in the display, click on the "=" button.

## Code Structure

The calculator application is implemented in a single Java class, `BasicCalculator.java`. The class extends the `JFrame` class to create a window for the application. The keypad is implemented using a `JPanel` with a `GridLayout`.

The application uses an expression evaluator to evaluate the arithmetic expressions entered by the user. The expression evaluator is implemented in a private inner class, `ExpressionEvaluator`.
